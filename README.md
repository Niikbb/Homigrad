## What is Homigrad?

Homigrad is a gamemode that expands on an existing game mode called 'Homicide,' which is inspired by Trouble in Terrorist Town (TTT) and Murder.\
It features a somewhat realistic health and movement system and offers several sub-modes, including Team Deathmatch (TDM), Deathmatch, and Hide and Seek.
